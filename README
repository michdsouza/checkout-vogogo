Assumptions:
Items are scanned one at a time

Receipt invokes pricing rules at the end of product 'scanning'
However, a running total is maintained per item scanned to give the customer an idea of what the current bill looks like as every item is scanned.

Contradictory rules / Rules prioritization
e.g. 3 apples for $1.30 (and) buy one apple, get one free.

If customer scans 5 apples, do we calculate the 'bulk' rule first, and then apply 'one and one free' on the remaining 2 apples. Or the other way around?

Ideally: Run both/all scenarios and pick the lowest outcome (for customer satisfaction) - or the highest outcome (for company profiteering)
		-- Not implmented. Level 2 functionality
Assumption: Run bulk pricing rule takes precedence always


Next level refactoring
- parsing logic for price rule different from applying price rule
- merely listed out prices. Not a listing of the discounts on the receipt.
- Can scan only one item at a time
